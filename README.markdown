# Robot Tournament

Robot Tournament is easist to install and run with Ruby Version Manager (RVM)..
Please Install RVM if you don't already have it.
    See http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/

Create and use the 'robot_tournament' gemset

    rvm --create gemset use robot_tournament

Install Bundler

    gem install bundler

Install the bundle

    bundle install
    
Robots are built by programmers and have to conform to a simple protocol:

  * uploaded as zip file
  * zip file contains a single folder in the root from which the robot will take it's name
  * the folder contains an executable file, 'move' which will be called by the tournament engine when the robot needs to make a move

See the features for examples, or the folder 'examples'

Use the following command to create and start a tournament:

    ./bin/create_tournament --name "battle royale" --rounds 5 --duration 10 --game rock_paper_scissors

You will also need to run

    ./bin/kick --repeat

Start the server like this to view the output

    ./bin/server

You might also want:

    ./bin/countdown

Turn up your speakers :)

The idea is to practice and encourage the XP principle of 'release early, release often' by rewarding early competitors with points.
